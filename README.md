# DT021A/4 IoT Module

### The IoT module is broken down into 3 sections:

- **Low Level Interfacing (BBC Micro:Bit using ZephyrOS) [3 weeks]**
- BTLE & MQTT [3 weeks]
- Server Side JS & Databases [2 weeks]

---
### Low Level Interfacing:
The low level interfacing section runs for the first 3 weeks and is focused on low level interfacing using the RTOS [Zephyr OS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) with a [BBC Micro:Bit V2](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/) which has a [Nordic nRF52833](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52833_PS_v1.4.pdf) at its core and a range of sensors and peripherals on board to interface with.

### Note: This is a work on progress and will be updated as the weeks go on
